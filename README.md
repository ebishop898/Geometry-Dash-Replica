# Geometry Dash Replica (Processing)

A simple Geometry Dash–style game built using **Processing**. This project recreates core gameplay mechanics from the original game, including player movement, obstacle collision, and level progression.

This game was developed over a **two-week period** as a **final project for CSC 103: Creative Computing**, focusing on applying creative coding techniques to interactive game design.

## 🎮 Features
- Side-scrolling gameplay
- Player jump mechanics
- Obstacle generation and collision detection
- Restart on collision
- Basic physics (gravity and velocity)
- Custom visuals using Processing shapes

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Processing** (Java-based creative coding framework)
